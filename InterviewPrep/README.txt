/*********
**********YES THERE ARE STILL OPTIMIZATION POSSIBLE, Listed Below:

//as it can be complete MVVM project.
//Better commenting with apple doc or doxygen
//more refactor of code
//more test cases
//BDD using KIWI & Nimble framework & UITest Cases can also be added.
//More encapsulation in other classes
